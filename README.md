# slurmtools

This is a small set of useful tools for working on the University of Cambridge cluster.

## Set up

For convenience, make these functions available in your PATH.

```bash
cd # move to your HOME directory
git clone git@github.com:james-cranley/slurmtools.git # clone the repo to your home directory
export PATH="$HOME/slurmtools/src:$PATH" # add this line to your ~/.bashrc file
```

For email alerts, make sure an environemnt variable `MY_CAM_EMAIL` is set, by adding this line to your ~/.bashrc

```bash
export MY_CAM_EMAIL=foo1234@cam.ac.uk # your email
```

## qjump

This is a simple function to identify the slurm partition that is likely to give you the shortest wait time. The principal is to look for the partition which has the **lowest** `Highest Priority` value.
You can edit the list of cpu and cpu partitions by editing the qjump script.

```bash
qjump # (quiet mode) returns the optimal **cpu** queue (same as running qjump --device cpu)
qjump --device gpu # (quiet mode) returns the optimal **gpu** queue
qjump --table # retutns a table of all queues
```

## slurmer

This is a function for making slurm submission scripts. It uses GNU parallel (which it loads as a module) so that it is generalised to work with both single and muliple commands.

## bashaslurm

This is a very simple bash function to strip the SBATCH lines from slurm scripts (such as those generated by slurmer) so that they can be run in interactive shell sessions (for instance conjured using `sintr`). It effectively means you can use slurmer to generate bash scripts.

```bash
bashaslurm slurmscript.sh
```
